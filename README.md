## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Styles

I'm using @emotion/styled library to add styling for more flexibilyty and better props managing.
As well we can use simply css modules in styles folder(I added example for this).

## Type control

I'm using basic react propTypes. But we can use Flow or Typescript instead.

## Helper folder

Store all reusable function and props

## Unit Tests

I'm using jest with React Testing library

to run test

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

to run test coverage

```bash
npm run test-coverage
# or
yarn test-coverage
```
